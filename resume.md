Employment
----------

2021 -- 2023
:   **Postdoc, Computational Biophysics**;
    *Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications, Italy*
    
    Protein folding molecular dynamics
    within the transition-path theory (Gromacs, Python, MDAnalysis).
    Studied an approach to a variational estimate of the committor function
    for some known fast-folding proteins.
    Wrote scripts to automate production and analysis of ratchet-and-pawl
    Gromacs simulations on a cluster (Bash, Makefile).
    Co-lectured a course on molecular physics for
    biology and computer science students.
    Assisted in maintaining servers and computer cluster infrastructure
    (Proxmox, slurm).

2015 -- 2019
:   **PhD student, Theoretical Nuclear Physics**;
    *Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany*
    
    Performed a supervised research on application of dispersion relations
    to timelike Compton scattering off the proton,
    low-energy quarkonium -- proton interaction
    and the hadronic light-by-light scattering in relation to muon's anomalous magnetic moment
    (Python, FORM).
    Did 3 semesters of teaching assistance in quantum mechanics and basic quantum field theory.

2014
:   **Python developer** at [ScienceWISE](https://info.arxiv.org/help/sciencewise.html) project;
    *Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland*

    Thesis: [*"Dispersion relations in two-photon hadronic processes"*](https://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-5257)
    
    Extended MSc study to a broader range of hadronic interactions,
    namely the dilepton photoproduction,
    the quarkonium -- proton scattering and the hadronic light-by-light scattering.
    The research resulted in multiple highly-cited papers.

:   **MSc, Theoretical Physics**; *Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine*
    
    Thesis: *"Causality constraints on the forward Compton scattering of the proton"*
    
    For the thesis, performed numerical calculations
    for the forward Compton scattering off the proton
    as a probe of its low-energy electromagnetic response structure,
    resulting in two published papers.

2009 -- 2013
:   **BSc, Theoretical Physics**; *Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine*
    
    Thesis: *"Maximal abelian gauge fixing in SU(2) lattice gluodynamics with OpenCL"*
    
    Obtained a ground knowledge of general sections of physics,
    with extensive classes in mathematics and computational methods.
    Got basic experience of programming in C and C++.
    For the thesis, (re)implemented a subroutine for the maximal abelian gauge fixing of
    $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills field on a lattice with OpenCL for GPUs.
